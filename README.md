# SoftwareDevProject

- This project is a Connect 4 game, however, the user can specify how many players will be playing, how many rows are on the board, how many columns are on the board, and how many placements in a row result in a win. The main focus of this project is not on the algorithms or on how difficult of a problem it is to solve but instead, the focus is on object oriented programming, separation of concerns, etc. All of which are super important in software engineering because it makes the code easy to read, maintain, modify, and debug.

- This project utilizes the Template Hook design pattern along with the Model View Controller architectural pattern which pairs nicely with the Graphical User Interface included.
