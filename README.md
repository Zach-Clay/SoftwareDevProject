# SoftwareDevProject

This is a project that I worked on for my Software Development Foundations class.

It is basically a connect 4 game, however, the user can specify how many players will be playing, how many rows are on the board, 
how many columns are on the board, and how many placements in a row result in a win. The main focus of this project is not on the algorithms
or on how difficult of a problem it is to solve but instead, the focus is on object oriented programming, separation of concerns, etc. All 
of which are super important in software engineering because it makes the code easy to read, maintain, modify, and debug.

If you wish to see some projects of mine that are more focused on complex data structures and algorithms I will be happy to share!
